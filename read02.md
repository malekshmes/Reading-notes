# What is it?

### It's a javaScript file that you should include in your web pages.
### It's used for selecting CSS-style selectors.
Usuallay, it's placed before the closing body tag. 
#### A function called jQuery
Another javaScript file should be included in order to use jQuery methods and selectors.
A shortcut for using it:
`$()`
INSTED OF;

# Programming can take a way where two people are working together to solve the same problem
### We call them:
- Driver: who doesn't touch the code.
- And a navigator: this one who writes the code and listen to the driver instructions.
# Why is *pair programming* better than *solo programming*?
- Pair programming produces higher-quality code, although it takes longer time than in solor working.
- Pair programming improve coders' language and problem solving skills. 

### It is a great way to share how you approach problems!
